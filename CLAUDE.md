# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a collection of "Head First" style educational cheatsheets for web development topics. It is a pure content repository with no build tools, package managers, or dependencies.

## Repository Structure

- Markdown cheatsheets: `html-cheatsheet.md`, `css-cheatsheet.md`, `javascript-cheatsheet.md`, `react-cheatsheet.md`, `nextjs-cheatsheet.md`
- PDF exports in root directory
- One HTML version: `html-cheatsheet.html`

## Content Style

All cheatsheets follow the "Head First" pedagogical approach:
- Conversational, engaging tone
- "Brain Power" exercises and puzzles
- "There are NO Dumb Questions" Q&A sections
- "Watch It!" warnings for common pitfalls
- Practical code examples
- Intentional redundancy for reinforcement
- Progressive complexity within each topic

## Git Workflow

- Remote: GitHub (`cedricmatalog/cheatsheets`)
- Branches: `main`, `gemini`
